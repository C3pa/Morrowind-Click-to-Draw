Description
____________

Allows you to use your mouse to ready your weapon, spell and also put them away. The keybinds are configurable.
By default, left click will draw a weapon while middle click will sheath it. Also, middle click will toggle
between spell ready/unready.

If you are looking for a similar mod for OpenMW, I recommend excellent Click To Prepare Weapon (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/57101) by Drasenix.
